# Popular Movies

This is the final project from [Udacity's](https://www.udacity.com/) Developing Android Apps Course.

To use this project on your own, you need an API Key from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/ "TMDB Homepage").
Simply create a login, get a key, and put it into the app/build.gradle file in the appropiate place.

##### The Great Error of 4/25/16
I accidently pushed the API key in a past commit, a huge no-no. Being unable to figure out the tools outlined by [Github](https://help.github.com/articles/remove-sensitive-data/ "Remove Sensitive Info") on how to remove this, I destroyed the repo, created a new project from scratch, and painstakingly copied everything over. Therefor, this current repo doesn't reflect about 75 commits for the project. Lesson Learned
